## (Free Third Person Shooter)
This is a program I have been working on for a day (as of 8/8/2018).  It's far from finished and isn't supposed to end up being much game.  It's supposed to be a simple little shooter.  It's not even supposed to have a menu.

## I want to add!
Great! The first time you open in unity might take a while to create local files.  Make sure you only upload when unity is closed.
## Multiplayer?
It will come soon.

The main point of the game is supposed to be multiplayer.  Also, Unity free only supports up to 20 players, so the game will only be able to hold 20 players, but I will host my own server eventually (When I get more than 20 players playing at once.

## Credits
 
 
There's nothing here but I'm going to credit anyone who contributes (if anyone does) and the assets I used from the asset store.
