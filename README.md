## (Free Third Person Shooter)
This is a program I have been working on for a day (as of 8/8/2018).  It's far from finished and isn't supposed to end up being much game.  It's supposed to be a simple little shooter.  It's not even supposed to have a menu.

## I want to add!
Great! The first time you open in unity might take a while to create local files.  Make sure you only upload when unity is closed.
## Multiplayer?
It will come eventually.

## Credits

There's nothing here but I'm going to credit anyone who contributes (if anyone does) and the assets I used from the asset store.
